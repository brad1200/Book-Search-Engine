# 21 MERN: Book Search Engine

## Overview
In this assignment we will be taking a functioning appliction and refactoring it using GraphQL and build with Apollo Server. This application is build using the full MERN stack which includes front and back end side of the application.

## Description
A user is able to search for books that they want. The user is allowed to sign into the app, they are then able to save books that they want and then be able to delete them from their list as well if they are signed in. 

### How it works
The user will be able to search whatever books they would like. They are then able to create an account for the app. Once they are signed in then they will still be able to search for books but then will have the option to save books which you are not able to do before logging in or creating an account. Once you save a book then there is a saved books tab that you can then see your saved books and then delete books from the list if the user wants to. Once done the user is able to log out of the application.
